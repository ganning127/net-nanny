## Inspiration
Net Nanny was inspired by the need for a safer online space for children. With the increasing amount of harmful content on the internet, we wanted to create a solution that empowers parents to protect their kids while allowing them to explore and learn.

## What it does
Net Nanny is a Chrome extension that blocks harmful messages and images during kids' online browsing. It filters inappropriate content in real-time.

## Challenges we ran into
We encountered some challenges while utilizing OpenAI's API, which required us to troubleshoot various integration and performance issues.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We’re proud of having developed a reliable and efficient filtering system in a remarkably short timeframe, demonstrating our team’s dedication and expertise.

## What we learned
We learned the importance of user feedback in refining our product. Engaging with parents helped us understand their needs and concerns, leading to valuable enhancements in our extension.

## What's next for Net Nanny
In the future, we will implement several key features to enhance Net Nanny's effectiveness and user experience. We plan to introduce a parental approval system, allowing parents to approve or deny access to potentially harmful content, which will give them greater control over their child's online experience. Additionally, we aim to launch weekly reports that provide parents with a detailed overview of their child's browsing history, offering insights into their online activities and fostering discussions about internet safety. Furthermore, we are excited to explore partnerships with schools to integrate Net Nanny on school-issued laptops and tablets, ensuring a safer online environment for students during school hours. These improvements will empower parents and create a more secure digital space for children to explore.
